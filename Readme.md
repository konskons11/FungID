# FungID

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/konskons11/ViRAE/total?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/konskons11/FungID/releases/)

FungID is a pilot software/application designed to revolutionize the identification of fungal species by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and chromogenic profiling. This innovative tool utilizes a unique approach, scanning image(s) input by the user for detectable culture plates (i.e. Petri dishes) and analyzing the distinctive color patterns of fungal colonies to accurately classify the examined species. 

Implemented using Python 3.8, FungID integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, and other libraries such as tkinter for the GUI, cv2 (OpenCV) for image processing, numpy for numerical operations, h5py for handling HDF5 files, PIL (Pillow) for image manipulation, and tensorflow.keras (TensorFlow) for building and training the neural network model. The application features a user-friendly GUI, offering functionalities such as parameter adjustments for efficient culture plate detection, real-time monitoring of training progress, and direct visualization of classification results, thus making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners, regardless of their technical expertise. 

Further development of FungID is expected to be particularly valuable in clinical settings, where prompt and accurate fungal identification is crucial for effective diagnosis and treatment, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and advancing mycological research.

## FungID key features

### Training Mode

_Custom Model Training:_ Input the desired image(s) and utilize built-in features such as data augmentation, early stopping, and model checkpointing to train and ensure the best-performing version of your model is saved.

_Data Augmentation:_ ImageDataGenerator is utilized to enhance the training dataset with transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, improving model robustness.

_Real-Time Monitoring and Performance Metrics:_ The GUI displays real-time training progress and plots model performance metrics, including accuracy, loss, validation accuracy, and validation loss, with an option to be exported as graphs by the user.

### Testing Mode

_Parameter Adjustments for Fungal Species Detection:_ The user is able to detect multiple culture plates within a single input image and also tweak various software parameters in order to optimize fungal species detection.

_Image Processing:_ Preprocesses images using OpenCV techniques, including Gaussian blurring and Hough Circle Transform for detecting the circular regions of culture plates with the examined fungal species.

_Comprehensive Results:_ Visualize detected circular regions of culture plates and display classified results with predicted species and confidence levels. (Options to save classification reports and processed images are also provided)

## User manual

### Installation 

The ViRAE standalone application is a Bash shell script distributed for Linux and MacOS systems and may be executed directly after making the downloaded ViRAE.sh file executable (e.g. command `chmod +x`). The prerequisites of ViRAE ([bwa 0.7.17](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases/tag/v0.7.17) and [samtools 1.13](https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/tag/1.13)) will be verified for installation upon ViRAE execution and if not installed, they will be downloaded automatically by the program.

### Execution

The parameters of the ViRAE standalone application are summarised in the following table:
|Required arguments|Description|Deployment|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`-i <string>`|directory of INPUT NGS READS file (.fastq, .fq or .gz extension)|Full|
|`-r <string>`|directory of INPUT REFERENCE file (.fasta, .fa, .fna, .fsta or .gz extension)|Full|
|`-m <string>`|directory of MAPPED NGS READS on REFERENCE file (.bam extension)|Partial|
|`-o <string>`|directory of OUTPUT folder|Full & Partial|

|Optional arguments|Description|Deployment|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`-l <integer>`|alignment stringency value (default value 30 \| <30 loose, >30 stringent)|Full|
|`-u <string>`|directory of UNMAPPED NGS READS on INPUT REFERENCE file (.bam, .fastq, .fq or .gz extension)|Partial|
|`-t`|run ViRAE on a test dataset to verify installation|TEST MODE|

### Run examples

In order to better comprehend the use and output of the ViRAE standalone application, we highly recommend inputting the -t flag only the first time you run it so as to deploy ViRAE on a small test dataset, which also verifies the installation of all prerequisites and downloads them automatically if needed.

ViRAE test mode run example:
```sh
./ViRAE.sh -t
```

For non-test run, the ViRAE standalone application may be fully or partially deployed upon execution depending on the available user input files. In the case of ViRAE full deployment, the directories of NGS reads (FASTQ format) and appropriate reference file (FASTA format) must be provided as arguments after the -i and -r flags respectively, in order to be able to perform all necessary alignments. The user also has the ability to adjust the mapping sensitivity of the incorporated BWA software by passing the desired level of alignment stringency as an integer number after the -l flag (default value 30 \| <30 loose, >30 stringent). 

Full ViRAE deployment run examples:
```sh
./ViRAE.sh -i reads.fastq -r ref.fasta -o ./
./ViRAE.sh -i reads.fq.gz -r ref.fasta.gz -o ./
./ViRAE.sh -i reads.fq.gz -r ref.fasta.gz -l 40 -o ./
```

For the alternative and faster partial deployment of ViRAE, in which the user may have already carried out the desired alignment with the mapping software of preference, the directory of a BAM file may only be provided after the -m flag, instead of FASTQ and FASTA files. Alongside the input BAM file, the user may optionally pass the output unmapped reads of the performed alignment in FASTQ or BAM format after the -u flag, for later use by the algorithm. 

Partial ViRAE deployment run examples:
```sh
./ViRAE.sh -m mapped.bam -o ./
./ViRAE.sh -m mapped.bam -u unmapped.bam -o ./
./ViRAE.sh -m mapped.bam -u unmapped.fq.gz -o ./
```

### Output

ViRAE outputs 2 files, which are: i) the clean reads after processing as a GZIPPED FASTQ file with the suffix "_ViRAE_cleaned.fastq.gz_", and ii) a detailed cleaning report file named "_ViRAE_cleaning_report.out.gz_". The generated GZIPPED FASTQ file contains all the clean reads by ViRAE and may be used separately for _de novo_ assembly or other downstream analysis. The generated report file is a multi-column file, which provides further information and details on the cleaning performed by ViRAE, in the following format:
|Column header|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Read_ID|Unique read sequence identifier|
|RefID|Unique reference sequence identifier|
|CIGAR|Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report string|
|Read_seq|Complete read sequence|
|Read_seqlength|Total read sequence length|
|Mapped_seq|Mapped sequence of read|
|Mapped_seq_length|Mapped sequence length of read|
|Mapped_start|Mapping start position of read|
|Mapped_end|Mapping end position of read|
|Left_unmapped_seq_start|New start position of read sequence after left-side trimming|
|Left_unmapped_seq_end|New end position of read sequence after left-side trimming|
|Left_unmapped_seq|New read sequence after left-side trimming|
|Left_unmapped_seq_quality|New read sequence quality after left-side trimming|
|Left_unmapped_seqlength|New read sequence length after left-side trimming|
|Right_unmapped_seq_start|New start position of read sequence after right-side trimming|
|Right_unmapped_seq_end|New end position of read sequence after right-side trimming|
|Right_unmapped_seq|New read sequence after right-side trimming|
|Right_unmapped_seq_quality|New read sequence quality after right-side trimming|
|Right_unmapped_seqlength|New read sequence length after right-side trimming|

An overall summary of the ViRAE analysis is also provided at the end of the generated report file, which has the following line-by-line format:
|Line header|Description|

## ViRAE web-based application (online)

Apart from the ViRAE standalone application, the user may utilize the [ViRAE online tool](https://srv-inseqt.med.duth.gr/ViRAE/HTML/ViRAE_method_selection.html), which does not require the installation of any software but solely the provision of the appropriate input files according to the following 3 steps:

**A) Deployment method selection:** Similarly to the standalone application, the user may choose to fully or partially deploy ViRAE depending on the available input through our online platform. If NGS reads and reference files are available in FASTQ and FASTA formats respectively, then the user should choose “Method 1” as displayed below, which corresponds to full ViRAE deployment. Alternatively, if the user has already performed the desired alignment between the NGS reads and reference file of preference, then “Method 2” should be selected, which stands for the faster partial deployment of ViRAE, with the sole input of the appropriate BAM file.

**B) Input files upload:** Clicking on the ViRAE deployment method of preference, redirects the user to the upload webpage. Upon selection of full ViRAE deployment (Method 1), the webpage displays three different upload options to choose from, for the necessary FASTQ and FASTA files separately. These upload options, as displayed below, are: 
1) selection of FASTQ or FASTA input file from a prompt file dialog,
2) submission of a valid SRA accession number (in the case of FASTQ input) or selection from a dropdown menu list of recommended reference files (in the case of FASTA input), or
3) provision of the appropriate link address, where the FASTQ or FASTA input file is stored.

As regards to the partial ViRAE deployment (Method 2), there are two available upload options, which are: 
1) selection of the necessary BAM input file from a prompt file dialog, or
2) provision of the appropriate link address, where the necessary BAM input file is stored.

![ViRAE_online guide](https://i.imgur.com/xUQG3CO.png "ViRAE online - Method 2 upload selection")

Submission of the required input files triggers the upload process and redirects to a new webpage, where the user is informed about the upload progression in real time. In case of upload failure, the user is redirected automatically back to the upload webpage after clicking "OK" on the prompted warning message.

**C) ViRAE implementation and output:** After successful upload of the appropriate input files, the back-end script execution of ViRAE begins and the user is informed about its progression in real time as displayed below. Upon ViRAE run completion, an overall summary is displayed at the current webpage, along with a download link corresponding to a zipped folder containing the clean reads and generated report files by ViRAE.
